          The 'Fish Supper' consists of fish (commonly haddock in Scotland) deep
          fried in batter with chips purchased from a 'Chip shop'. It is
          traditionally served wrapped first in brown paper, then in newspaper
          in order that the food should retain its heat on the customer's
          journey home.

          This is more than a foodstuff in Scotland - it is truly a tradition.

          The traditional question from the Chip Shop proprietor to the customer
          on serving the delicacy: 'Anyhin oan it?' can be met with the
          reply,'Sauce an salt' in the East coast and, 'Salt an vinegar' in the
          West. This cultural difference between East and West coasts was once
          famously used to advertise the rail connection between Edinburgh and
          Glasgow. In Glasgow the fish supper and othe fried foodstuffs sold on
          the premises is often accompanied by a bottle of 'Ginger' (fizzy juice
          such as Cola or Irn Bru, the latter once advertised and still referred
          to by some as 'Yer other national drink'.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Customers who do not require chips ask for a 'Single fish' while those
          with larger appetites might request a 'muckle' (big) fish with their
          chips. Other accompaniments traditionally available from chip shops
          include pickled eggs (boiled eggs in vinegar) and giant silverskin
          pickled onions.
